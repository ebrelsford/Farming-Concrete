                <p><a href="http://farmingconcrete.org/">Farming Concrete</a> is a three-year grassroots science project measuring food production in NYC community gardens and school gardens. There are over 500 community gardens in NYC, at least 80% of which grow food, and the number of school gardens in the city is growing rapidly.</p>
                <p>Using simple record keeping methods, Farming Concrete works with gardeners as they record their yields. These numbers can be used to access resources, advocate for  permanency, support the argument for more gardens, and more. By democratizing the data and research processes, Farming Concrete hopes to achieve greater access to and sovereignty over the power of information.
                <p>To carry out the project, Farming Concrete trained a team of community gardeners to train new gardens. With methods adapted from a similar study done in Philadelphia, gardens participate in one or both of two parts. The first is called Harvest Count, for which gardeners receive a free scale and harvest log and weigh their harvests by crop.  The second, called Crop Count, is an inventory of the number of plants growing, per crop, for an entire garden. This is done one to three times in a garden throughout the growing season to account for succession planting. The average pounds per plant recorded by gardeners is applied to the number of plants recorded in the Crop Count to arrive at the estimated overall garden yield. This yield is then monetized using prices from Whole Foods to account for premiums on local produce.</p>

                <p>Many thanks to our partners, GreenThumb (NYC Parks & Recreation), Just Food, and New York Restoration Project, for their time, support, and resources - they have been critical to making this project a success. We also thank our supporters, including NY Community Trust, William & Mary Greve Foundation, and Norcross Wildlife Foundation. The New School has also acted generously in providing us with student help.</p>
                <p>We are very grateful for similar studies that took place in the past few years, measuring food production in community gardens in Philadelphia (UPenn 2009), Camden, and Trenton. We owe many aspects of our methodology to them.</p>
                <p>We also want to thank Megan Gregory, PhD candidate at Cornell University, for sharing her work with us. She has and continues to offer critical guidance in methodology and implementation.</p>

                    <li>Not all gardens participating in 2011 and 2012 were community gardens, there were also school gardens and a small handful of backyard gardeners.</li>
                    <li>We couldn’t estimate yields for every crop reported. For example, some gardens recorded cilantro in square feet as opposed to number of plants. We do not have data on the average number of cilantro plants per square foot, and so could not estimate yield using our formula. If there was one plant per square foot, there would be 118 additional cilantro plants, yielding 426 lbs and $4,500 worth of cilantro.</li>
                    <li>Estimates based on crops weighed by gardeners. Not all crops were weighed, and not all yields were necessarily recorded. As such, this is a very conservative estimate.</li>
