                <a href="http://www.farmingconcrete.org/">Farming Concrete</a> is a volunteer, citizen science project to measure how much food is grown in New
                York City's community gardens. Calculating the area, weight, and monetary value of food grown in these
                spaces highlights the value of community gardens as important green spaces run by and for neighborhood
                residents and gives them a defined place in the context of the urban food system.
                <br /><br />
                A team of more than twenty volunteer researchers, students, interns, and gardeners are working with
                hundreds of gardens to map areas under production, measure total acreage, and track harvest volume by
                crop. This map will continue to change and develop as we continue our work for the duration of 2010. In
                the end, the data will be able to answer for each garden and for all gardens as a whole:
                <br /><br />
                "We at ___ Community Garden grew ___ pounds of food in ____ square feet, which is worth $$___, served approximately ___ people, and prevented approximately __ pounds of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere."
                <br /><br />

                More than 100 gardeners have been weighing their yield by crop, recording
                the number of plants they have as well. Meanwhile, gardeners and Farming
                Concrete volunteers and interns have been conducting crop inventory to be
                able to include the vegetable beds of those gardeners who are not weighing
                their produce. Here's how this worked:

                <h1>Data collection</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact gardeners on foot or over the phone</li>
                    <p>
                        If garden was interested in participating:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bring a scale and a harvest log</li>

                    <p>
                        For the rest of the growing season:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gardeners weigh their produce</li>
                            <li>Outreach and mapping continues</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <h1>Data analysis</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Calculate total yield recorded so far for each plant of each crop recorded by each gardener</li>
                    <li>Calculate average yield of 1 plant of each crop recorded so far (July &amp; August)</li>
                    <li>Tally number of plants of each crop for each garden</li>
                    <li>Apply average yield for each crop to number of plants tallied for each garden</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>In other words</h1>
                Weighing = pounds per plant of each crop<br />
                Mapping = number of plants of each crop per garden<br />
                Yield = pounds of each crop per garden

                Many thanks to our partners, GreenThumb (NYC Parks &amp; Recreation), Just Food, and New York Restoration Project, for their time, support, and resources - they have been critical to making this project a success. The New School has also acted generously in providing us with a humbling amount of student help as well as space at their exhibit this fall, Living Concrete/Carrot City.
                <br /><br />
                We are very grateful for two studies that took place in the past few years, measuring
                food production in community gardens in Boston (Boston Natural Areas Network
                2009) and in Philadelphia (UPenn 2009). We owe many aspects of our methodology
                to them.
                <br /><br />
                We also want to thank Megan Gregory, PhD candidate at Cornell University, for
                sharing her work with us. She has and continues to offer critical guidance in
                methodology and implementation.
